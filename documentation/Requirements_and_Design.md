## 2. Project Description

DiveBuddy is an app designed for scuba divers of all levels who are looking to connect with fellow divers and 
discover events that help them enhance their diving skills and enjoy safer diving experiences. The app will serve as a platform which addresses the common challenges divers face in discovering diving sessions, coordinating with dive clubs, and finding reliable dive partners. By centralizing event listings, sign-ups, and a buddy-matching system in one platform, DiveBuddy helps users easily discover upcoming dives, register for events, and connect with fellow divers nearby. This creates a stronger sense of community, encourages safer diving through reliable partnerships, and increases engagement with sports clubs organizing the activities.

What sets DiveBuddy apart is its real-time buddy matching feature and event management system. By leveraging users' profiles and preferences, the app's matching algorithm will suggest compatible dive partners based on factors such as certification levels, diving experience, location and availability. This ensures that divers can find suitable partners who match their skill level and interests, enhancing safety and enjoyment during dives. Additionally, the event management system will allow clubs to efficiently organize and manage dive events, handle registrations, and communicate with participants through notifications. This streamlines the event planning process and ensures that divers have access to a variety of diving opportunities. Overall, DiveBuddy aims to foster a vibrant diving community by making it easier for divers to connect, discover events, and enhance their diving experiences through reliable partnerships and organized activities.
