# Requirements and Design

## 1. Change History

| **Change Date**   | **Modified Sections** | **Rationale** |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Oct 27, 2025 | 4.1 Main Components<br>4.5 Dependencies Diagram | Based on M2 feedback from our TA, the following improvements were made:<br>- Combined "Users" and "Profiles" components into single "Users" component<br>- Removed three separate database components into just using one "MongoDB" component (that contains three collections: users, events, chat)<br>- "Google Maps API" no longer interacts with any backend components, it only interacts with frontend |
| Oct 27, 2025 | 3.7 Non-Functional Requirements | Based on M2 feedback we changed our second non-functional requirement to be one that is more testable. At first it was about our server uptime being 99.5%, but now we opted for it to reflect our API response times, which would be easier to test for our project. |
| Oct 27, 2025 | 3.5 Formal Use Case Specifications | Changes to most specifications based on how our app ended up being implemented. <ul><li>Split the Match with Other User use case into two separate use cases: Find Matches, and Match with Other User. </li><li>Create Event use case no longer has upload image, but has description field, to reflect how the use case actually functions on the app.</li><li> Set-up profile also has upload image part removed, as users can already change their image in the “Manage Profile” screen which is separate from this use case. Additionally, all fields here are optional, as users can navigate to manage profile to add them at anytime.</li><li>Browse events no longer contains information about registering for an event, as that is handled in a separate use case.</li></ul>
 | Oct 27, 2025 | 3.4 Use Case Description | Updated use case descriptions to be more consistent with our actual implementation and use case specifications: <ul><li>Feature 2: Removes diving conditions and certificates in favor of adding bio and name. Diving conditions and certificates are relatively open ended responses that can easily be explained in the bio section.</li> <li>Feature 3: Some name/field changes to improve consistency with the rest of the document. </li><li> Feature 4: Reflects the fact that we split Match with Other User into two use cases: Find Matches and Match with Other User</li></ul>
 | Oct 27, 2025 | 3.2 Use Case Diagram | Updated to reflect how we split the Match with Other User use case into two use cases as described above. |
| Oct 27, 2025 | 4.4 Frameworks | Added Retrofit and Socket.IO frameworks for Android because they are used on the frontend for HTTP requests and live websocket for chats. |

## 2. Project Description

DiveBuddy is an app designed for scuba divers of all levels who are looking to connect with fellow divers and discover events that help them enhance their diving skills and enjoy safer diving experiences. The app will serve as a platform which addresses the common challenges divers face in discovering diving sessions, coordinating with dive clubs, and finding reliable dive partners. By centralizing event listings, sign-ups, and a buddy-matching system in one platform, DiveBuddy helps users easily discover upcoming dives, register for events, and connect with fellow divers nearby. This creates a stronger sense of community, encourages safer diving through reliable partnerships, and increases engagement with sports clubs organizing the activities.

What sets DiveBuddy apart is its real-time buddy matching feature and event management system. By leveraging users' profiles and preferences, the app's matching algorithm will suggest compatible dive partners based on factors such as certification levels, diving experience, location and availability. This ensures that divers can find suitable partners who match their skill level and interests, enhancing safety and enjoyment during dives. Additionally, the event management system will allow clubs to efficiently organize and manage dive events, handle registrations, and communicate with participants through notifications. This streamlines the event planning process and ensures that divers have access to a variety of diving opportunities. Overall, DiveBuddy aims to foster a vibrant diving community by making it easier for divers to connect, discover events, and enhance their diving experiences through reliable partnerships and organized activities.

## 3. Requirements Specification

### **3.1. List of Features**

- Authentication: To use the app, a user must use Google Authentication to Sign In. New users must Sign Up before Signing In. Users can sign out and also delete their account.

- Profile Management: After the authentication Sign Up process, the user will see a pop up form with fields that they must fill out to complete their profile. The fields will be: Name, Age, City, Experience Level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and Bio (open text input). The user will be able to update their profile after the initial set up, in order to reflect any new changes. The City field will be a dropdown from the Google Maps API. Name will be a textbox, Age will be a number, Experience level will be a dropdown, and Bio is a text input of up to 1000 characters. A user can add a profile photo as well.

- Event Management: Users will be able to create an event and become the event organizer. When creating the event, the user will be able to fill a form with the following fields: Name (text), Date/Time (DateTimePicker), Location (with Google Maps API), user capacity (number), estimated skill level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced). They can also upload an image for the event. The event organizer can update any of the fields of the event, as well delete the event. Users can view all of the above information about the event prior to joining, including the attendees list, and they will be added to the attendees list after joining.
Users can view all of the events they have joined/created, as well as their status of Organizer/Attendee. Users can leave an event they have joined, and it will remove themselves from the attendee list. Events can be discovered through the Browse Events tab, and users can join events from there.

- Buddy Matching: Users will be able to match with a single diving buddy if they are looking for a partner when diving because it is never recommended to go diving alone. With the user’s profile information, including their location and skill level, the buddy matching algorithm can be invoked to find a list of top other users that are compatible with the current user.

- Chat: Users can create chat rooms with other users who are attending events with them, or with a buddy they match with.

### **3.2. Use Case Diagram**

![Use Case Diagram](../documentation/images/use-case-diagram-2.png)

### **3.3. Actors Description**

1. **User**: An app user who is logged into the app using their Google account. Has access to all app features. Users must use Google Authentication to Sign Up and make an account.
2. **Event Organizer**: A user who has created an event is the event organizer of that event.
3. **Event Attendee**: A user who has joined an event is called an event attendee.
4. **Google Maps API**: Third Party API responsible for location data in profiles and events.
5. **Google Authentication API**: Third Party API responsible for user authentication.

### **3.4. Use Case Description**
#### Use cases for feature 1: Authentication
- Sign Up: The user uses Google Authentication to create an account
- Sign In: The user uses Google Authentication to sign into their account.
- Sign Out: The user signs out of their account.
- Delete Account: The user deletes their account (also signing them out). The user should no longer be able to sign in with their old credentials after this action is done.
  
#### Use cases for feature 2: Profile Management
- Set-Up Profile: The user sets their account information on account creation to reflect their age, location, experience level, name, and bio. Setting these preferences will allow for optimal buddy matching.
- Update Profile: The user can update their profile to reflect any changes to it that have occurred since they set up their account initially.
  
#### Use cases for feature 3: Event Management
- Create Event: A user can create an event on the app with information about the event, including name, date/time, location (with map API), user capacity, and skill level requirements. This user becomes the event organizer.
- Update Event: The event organizer can update information for an event they have made. Updates will notify users who have joined the event.
- Delete Event: The event creator can delete an event they have created. This will notify users who have joined the event and remove them from the event.
- Browse Events: Users can browse through events created by dive club owners. Events can be browsed from a list view, showcasing information about the event such as location, date and time.
- Register for Event: Users can join events that they see on their feed, given that the event has enough capacity. These users become event attendees.
- Leave Event: The user who has previously registered for an event will be able to leave the event by clicking a button.
- Receive Event Updates: After a user has joined an event, they will receive notifications if the event creator makes any updates to the event or deletes the event.
- Chat with event organizers/attendees: Upon a user creating or joining an event, they will have access to a chat room available to all event attendees and the event organizer, where they can send messages to co-ordinate event planning or get to know each other before meeting up.

#### Use cases for feature 4: Buddy Matching
- Find Matches: A user can use the information that they’ve set in their profile to request to match with a diving buddy. The matching algorithm will find a list of top matches who have similar experience level and interests.
- Match with Other User: A user can view the profile for each match and tap on the match button if they are interested in contacting them. A chat between the user and the match will be created.

#### Use cases for feature 5: Chat
- Chat: After matching as buddy with another user, the users use the created chat room to chat with each other to coordinate joining events together, or go on diving excursions themselves. A chat room can also be opened between users who are attendees of the same event.
- Block User: When a user blocks another user, they can no longer message or receive messages from the user

### **3.6. Screen Mock-ups**

### **3.7. Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Real-time User Experience SLOs (Matching and Chat)**
    - **Description**: Buddy algorithm suggestions return in ≤1.0s p95 when there are 10,000 users in the database.
    - **Justification**: This is to maintain a positive user experience. The app’s value lies in its ability for live coordination with other users, so a slow matching process will contribute to a poor user experience.
    - **Why these numbers**: 1s is the upper bound users still perceive as visual "instant" and p95 means 95% of users will be able to achieve these response times. We believe that when the app is fully released, we will see an active userbase of around 10000 members, so we will use this metric to simulate a release environment. (<https://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux>)
2. **API Response Times**
    - **Description**: Our backend API, which handles requests from the Android application for authentication, event registration, and chat, should respond within 500 milliseconds under normal load.
    - **Justification**: Maintaining low response times is crucial to ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile devices, where network latency can already introduce delays. A quick API response helps our app feel responsive, prevents user frustration, and ensures real-time features like chat and event registration remain seamless.
    - **Why these numbers**: According to Odown, high-performing APIs typically respond within 300–500 ms, which is considered a “very good” benchmark in the industry. This makes 500 ms a realistic and measurable performance target for our backend.(<https://odown.com/blog/api-response-time-standards>)

### **4.2. Databases**

1. **MongoDB**
    - **Purpose**: For storing data related to profiles, events, and chat message
    - **Reason**: NoSQL database was chosen over SQL database for more flexible schemas that may evolve over time

### **4.3. External Modules**

1. **Google Auth**
    - **Purpose**:  For secure OAuth login/sign-up with minimal setup
2. **Google Maps API**
    - **Purpose**: For location-based event creation and browsing
3. **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**
    - **Purpose**: For event update notifications and buddy match alerts
    - Note: This is not implemented yet in our MVP, but we will integrate it in M5.

### **4.4. Frameworks**

1. **AWS (EC2 + S3)**
    - **Purpose**: For scalable backend hosting and image storage (e.g., storing user profile pictures, event images)
    - **Reason**: Chosen over Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform because AWS is most mature, widely adopted, and as students we want to learn it for job competitiveness
2. **Node.js with Express.js**
    - **Purpose**: Backend API framework chosen for simplicity, large ecosystem, and real-time websocket support with Socket.IO
3. **Retrofit with Android**
    - **Purpose**: Frontend framework for sending HTTP requests to the backend
4. **Socket.io with Android**
    - **Purpose**: Frontend framework for websocket connections, used for real-time chats

### **4.7. Design and Ways to Test Non-Functional Requirements**
1. [**Real-time User Experience SLOs (Matching and Chat)**]
    - **Validation**: Efficient database queries and a WebSocket-based implementation are used to enable real-time matching and chat updates, ensuring responses are delivered within 1 second under typical load. This can be tested using load-testing tools like K6 or Artillery to simulate 10,000 users and measure 95th-percentile response times.
2. [**API Response Times**]
    - **Validation**: The Express.js backend uses asynchronous I/O, optimized query handling, and minimal middleware to reduce latency, ensuring API responses remain within the 500 ms target. This can be tested using tools such as Postman or K6 to measure response times of key endpoints under normal load.
